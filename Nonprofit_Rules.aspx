    </ol>

    <h3>Guidelines for a Successful Proposal</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The best proposals start with a great idea.</li>
        <li>Make sure your proposal is for a mobile app, not a desktop or web application.</li>
        <li>Although we all want your proposal to result in something this is spectacular, ensure that the proposal is simple enough to be finished in one weekend.</li>
        <li>Successful proposals are well-thought out, focused, and include enough detail to efficiently communicate your vision to the reviewers.</li>
        <li>Describe what you need the application to do and what problems you need to solve. Don’t include superfluous or redundant information. This isn’t a grant proposal. </li>
        <li>Answer all the questions in the application. Incomplete proposals will not be accepted.</li>
        <li>Try not to wait until the last minute. Get your proposal in early, if at all possible.</li>
    </ol>
