            </li>
            <li>
	            Seattle GiveCamp reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies 
                to immediately leave the Seattle GiveCamp facilities and may elect to ban such individuals
                from participation in all Seattle GiveCamp activities and events.
            </li>
        </ul>

	    <h2>Seattle GiveCamp's Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>
        <p>
	        Seattle GiveCamp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
	        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in
	        any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Seattle GiveCamp event or activity, including workshops. Anyone in violation of these
	        policies may expelled from Seattle GiveCamp activities and events at the discretion of the Seattle GiveCamp organizing committee.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing
	        photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion;
	        and patronizing language or action.
        </p>
        <p>
	        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
	        Seattle GiveCamp activities, events, and workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
	        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
	        You can contact them at <a href="mailto:info@seattlegivecamp.org">info@seattlegivecamp.org</a>. Event staff will be happy to help participants contact
	        venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
	        If you cannot reach an event organizer or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Seattle GiveCamp staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our
	        team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values
	        and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.
        </p>
        <p>
	        We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
        </p>
