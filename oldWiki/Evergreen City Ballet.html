<strong>Work Request:</strong><br />
We need an integrated database to keep track of our donors, patrons, school families, with email, postal address, notes, etc. It would be great if this could talk to our online registration system.<br />
<br />
This is important both for administrative purposes--our school is growing rapidly--and as a foundation for building out our ability to fundraise. While all of this is quite straightforward, without it we are finding ourselves increasingly handicapped in running our organization.<br />

<strong>PM Notes:</strong><br />
They want Salesforce.<br />

<strong>Current System:</strong> Our website is a WordPress site, hosted on GoDaddy servers. We use Excel spreadsheets for our mailing list that is on a machine in office, not online. We have a google drive, dropbox and online storage from GoDaddy that we share files on Online class man<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> No. We looked at online donor management systems, but they were too expensive for us at this point. Mostly, it is important to us that we have as efficient and streamlined a set of systems as possible. This can be difficult when working across a variety of proprietary platforms.<br />
Thank you!<br />

<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br />
Evergreen City Ballet is a school and company based in Renton. Established in 1994, since 2008 it has been led by Executive/Artistic Director Kevin Kaiser.<br />
<br />
Since 2008 ECB has:<br />
1. retired a substantial inherited operating debt,<br />
2. created an operating cushion,<br />
3. tripled school enrollment,<br />
4. brought the summer session to full capacity with students from all over the United States<br />
5. raised audience attendance by 200% for our company performances,<br />
6. instituted ELEVATE, a performance project for the Professional Program students wherein students choreograph, perform, direct all technical aspects at our black box theater and<br />
7. created Dance ALIVE! student outreach program (free to schools and students) week-long seminars in dance technique and healthy lifestyles for over 20,000 elementary school students in 6 schools districts in South King County.<br />
<br />
ECB is creating the organizational capacity to expand our ability to fulfill our mission of providing top quality professional calibre performances to cities from Kirkland to Tacoma and training to students of all backgrounds, ethnicities, abilities and financial status to the highest possible level. We have the facilities to substantially expand our regular enrollment, and, we are in the first stages of building a full scholarship program for students discovered through Dance ALIVE! with an eventual goal of having 250 students a year on full scholarship (including classes, dance wear, shoes, incidental costs and transport) at ECB's facility. Because our local communities often don't have much familiarity or sympathy with ballet, we are planning the inaugural series of in-school lecture demonstration performances. More familiarity, along with witnessing the joy, discipline, physical and creative expression that dance provides will be one way to get our Dance ALIVE! students' families and peers to be as enthusiastic as the kids themselves. This engagement is a necessity for a successful program, and we've already had immense success with building audience enthusiasm for our full scale performances.<br />
<br />
At ECB we truly believe that all kids can dance and that all kids will love it if they are taught with care, integrity, purpose, acceptance of challenges and celebration of their individual strengths. It would be terrific if Seattle GiveCamp could help us do this better.
