 <br />
Our plan is to develop and build a global database of willing and qualified volunteer Plumbers, who wish to be connected with non-profits, working to increase access to safe water and sanitation, both local and global. This database will be a resource both for other npo's as well as for potential volunteers. With thousands of organizations already working to help bring safe water and sanitation to those in need, and the thousands of professional Plumbers in the world who wish to be a part of the global solution, we thought a way to connect them to each other would be a win-win and have positive effects on health, worldwide.<br />
<br />
We would like to have a way (user interface ?) for volunteer Plumbers to enlist for potential volunteer opportunities on our website, and in so doing, the data they would give us about their themselves: skillsets, experience, availability, certifications, languages spoken, etc. etc...would go directly into a database, which we could then do queries, and reports, in order to find suitable matching of volunteers with non-profits who would also registere on our website for potential help.<br />
<br />
As for the database, we have been exploring Salesforce and Dynamics as the 2 potential crm's. We see the benefits of using Dynamics to more fully and efficiently integrate with Microsoft Outlook, however it seems that Salesforce offers a more easily accessed structure for development, plus they offer the first 10 user licenses free of charge to charities, which is critical to us, as we in the grass-roots stage, operating on limited means.<br />
<br />
We're tracking our current volunteers on excel sheets and manually searching for suitable matches when we get a request.<br />
<br />
The goal is to establish local chapters around the world, similar to the model we're establishing with Habitat for Humanity- King County, with whom we have a working alliance, helping them re-plumb foreclosed homes.<br />
Once our database is built, and we have a way for volunteers and non-profits to input their data, and auto-populate the database, we'll be able to establish and support additional local chapters of Plumbers Without Borders, so volunteer Plumbers can help out in their own communities, as well as be registered for potential disaster-relief work.<br />
<br />
Our website is a free wordpress site, very basic, built by novice, trial &amp; error.<br />
Thank you so much!! Your help will propel us to the next level!<br />
