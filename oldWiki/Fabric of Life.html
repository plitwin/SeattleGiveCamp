<span style="font-size: 14px;">A designer has agreed to donate time to Fabric of Life to assist with the creation of a new website, and so all design work will be done ahead of GiveCamp. No elements of the old site will be utilized, so there will be no need to try to work with any elements of that site.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> We will need the following services:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">WordPress template chosen or built</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">E-commerce solution attached. This may involve assistance choosing a solution; we are attempting to have a solution chosen prior to GiveCamp.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Assistance making the site live.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">About:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Mali is one of the poorest countries on earth. Girls from rural families are sent to beg for a living on the streets of the cities to earn their own living or to help support their families. These girls are economically inactive--they have no skills other than begging to support themselves. They are subject to sexual and physical abuse, drug addiction, HIV infection, and malnutrition, and their life expectancy is shorter than the country average for females who do not beg.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Fabric of Life provides a two-year program for beggar girls in Bamako, Mali that accomplishes the following:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 14px;"> Provides training in traditional crafts such as weaving, fabric dying (several traditions), and beading. The girls then form self-managed producer cooperatives to produce high-qualitiy products which are then sold locally in Mali at the Fabric of Life store in Edmonds, Washington.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Provide education in nutrition, health, HIV/AIDS prevention, basic literacy, and basic business skills.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">During the program, provide a weekly stipend to the participants to ensure that they do not have to continue begging to support themselves.</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Fabric of Life is at a critical time in its existence and needs to increase its revenues in order to continue with its mission. To date, the organization has not utilized its online resources and now needs to focus heavily on building an online presence in order to increase its donor base, increase donations and sales, start a sponsorship program and publicize it, and conduct further outreach to a wider audience.</span><br />
