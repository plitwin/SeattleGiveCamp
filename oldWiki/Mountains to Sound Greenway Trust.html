<strong>Work Request:</strong> We need a mobile friendly version of our website. We have a basic structure and site map drawn up, and we would love some help pulling the pieces together to create it. This should be a project that is easily do-able in one weekend.<br />
You can check out our current website at mtsgreenway.org<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Our current website uses Plone (Plone 4.0.10).<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We are open to other platforms for the mobile website, it doesn't have to operate on Plone, it just needs to automatically redirect mobile users to the mobile website.<br />
However, we do have a few special features on our website that we'd like to make compatible on the mobile friendly version if possible (i.e. a calender that runs on Trumba, a custom Google map, and our volunteer and donation sign up pages which run through our Salesforce database).
