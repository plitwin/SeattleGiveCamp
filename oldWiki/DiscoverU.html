<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Proposal</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">We are pretty happy with our existing website - www.2discoveru.org - that we amatuers cobbled together on a wordpress platform. We however need some technical trouble shooting help with some or all of this list of relatively minor problems that are outside of our skills set. These include:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> a) Installing Adobe Flash player so we can play videos we make on our website</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> b) calendar on events page</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> b) setting up our email so that it works for us both sending and receiving</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> c) installing a donation button/paypal imbeded into each page</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> d) Set up a mail chimp to capture emails and incorporate into microsoft access</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> e) improve our social media exposure</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">About</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">DISCOVERU is a non-profit prevention organization that is dedicated to providing a powerful inside out solution to problems that today’s youth face every day. These challenges have grown to epidemic proportions and need immediate interventions. We believe that:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Wellness is the BEST Prevention</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> DiscoverU helps youth and families understand that “State of Mind” is one of the primary key foundational human factors that resides at the core of our wellness, innate health and wisdom. Once kids understand how they function in their natural wisdom and innate health, they can access it more naturally and effortlessly creating the resiliency that allows them to overcome anything that life throws at them.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Our workshops help youth and families to put to rest the self-doubt, frustration, chronic negative emotions, confusion, anxiety and the stress that often leads to bad decisions and behaviors that tears apart lives.</span>
