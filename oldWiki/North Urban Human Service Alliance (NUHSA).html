<strong>Contact:</strong> Beth Green<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> We want a basic website designed and implemented for a small non profit. We have worked with volunteer website designers to help us create basic wireframes and are currently rewriting our content.<br />
<br />
Our nonprofit, NUHSA, strives to be the voice for human services in North King County. We provide a leadership role during local and regional human service initiatives and decisions. We identify emerging needs within our area. We advocate for a continuum of care and accessibility to services and resources.<br />
<br />
Our current website is difficult to access the information on the site and what is available is generally outdated or hard to read. The tabs, headings, and sub-menus are not organized in a logical fashion. There is also a large amount of text on almost every page and the graphics are confusing. There is not much action they can take on the site, other than reading information.<br />
<br />
Wild Apricot, our website platform, limits us in what we can do in terms of design as well as content. It also does not provide an email service with our domain name. The websiteâ€™s design is sparse and dated, and it is disorganized. Navigating the menus is rather difficult and most of the information is outdated. We do not have effective connections to our social media and the newsletter options make formatting difficult. There is not much that is visually or intellectually engaging that will keep people on the website.<br />
<br />
We want visitors to our site to find information and be inspired to support human services in North King County through education, volunteering, advocating and becoming a NUHSA member. We want to include a map of our area, the agencies that serve our area as well as a RSS feed to volunteer opportunities in our area.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Our domain name and host is with dotster. Our content management is with Wild Apricot.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We are currently using Wild Apricot, it does not meet our needs for navigation or ease. We do not need the Member management services they offer. It is expensive for our small nonprofit.We have been advised that WordPress may be our best option for what we are seeking, ease of use and help available. Our nonprofit does not have an IT person. All website work is done in house by the only part time staff person.
