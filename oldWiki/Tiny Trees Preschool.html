Tiny Trees Preschool uses outdoor classrooms to make quality education in reading, math and science affordable and accessible to all families.<br />
Education is a proven path out of poverty and a successful education starts early. Children 3-5 that receive a preschool education prior to entering kindergarten are more likely to learn to read early, graduate high school, succeed in college and live longer and more productive lives. The problem however is that preschool is expensive. Full time preschool commonly costs a family as much as a year at the University of Washington. For the majority of families in Puget Sound the high cost makes it simply unattainable. 37% of Seattleâ€™s children are not enrolled in any child care or preschool program. An additional 20% attend for less than one day a week. Enrollment rates get worse outside of the city limits and are directly mirrored by school drop-out, expulsions, incarceration and health indicators. As our region continues to grow the need for preschool will become even more acute. Tiny Trees meets these needs through the development of affordable preschool delivered at scale throughout the region.<br />
Tiny Trees makes preschool affordable for families by tackling the root of the problem: facility and building costs. We break down the school house walls and take classes outside to local city parks where we combine quality math and reading instruction with a world class science education. By removing the cost of building, renovating and maintaining a licensed child care facility Tiny Trees is able to:<br />
<ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Reduce the cost of preschool by 20-30%.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Replicate easily and respond quickly to changing market demands by having low start-up costs &amp; overhead.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Provide a one of a kind, high impact educational experience in a learning environment that fosters creativity, healthy play and scientific inquiry.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Focus our financial resources on what really matters: hiring and supporting great teachers.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> None, this project would be designing and building a new website.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> WordPress is preferred since our staff have the most experience with it. Our staff do have some experience with Drupal but find it frustrating and would rather avoid. Currently GoDaddy is the host for our domains and we would like to have them host the final site.
