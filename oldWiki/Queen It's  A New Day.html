 We need technical assistance in working on our website.<br />
<br />
We have no one that knows anything to be able to help us right now!<br />
<br />
The things we need on a regular basis are: editing content on our website, adding inset videos and deleting content.<br />
<br />
We constantly have need for this but the company that is currently doing it for us is too busy to do anything right now. They have agreed to let someone else do the edits, etc. on it.<br />
<br />
When we have something that needs to be added, that is what we need help on.<br />
<br />
This would be an area that we would totally require expertise advice on. Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)<br />
<br />
Also, we would like a Queen, It's A New Day web app! That would not only inform people about our organization, website, but be able to drive sales. We do have PayPal on our website already.<br />
