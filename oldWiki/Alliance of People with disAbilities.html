<strong>Mission:</strong><br />
We work to make our community more accessible, inclusive, and usable for everyone<br />
<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong><br />
We want an application to specifically communicate with disabled youth in our youth group. The application (possibly Facebook or twitter based) to push content and distribute responses to our youth group. These could include:<br />
<ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Employment: job board for young adults, discussions, mentor matchup, trying on job oportunities, places to source appropriate clothing for work</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cooking with a Disability: Lunch ideas, cooking solutions, ask a chef</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dating and Disability: Just Ask Advise for Today, Resources, Disability Dating Ideas</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Be Prepared: Emergency Prep for teens, disaster checklist, how to find your friends after a disaster, first aid classes</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Art Gallery: Your Artwork section, what's new, Art happenings</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">About: Events, Moderator, Becoming a Submitter, Becoming a Mentor, app sponsors</span></li></ol><strong>Current System:</strong><br />
We are currently using WordPress on a linux server.<br />
We also use Facebook but none of their APIs<br />
Assume most users and maintainers are NOT tech savy<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We are in a separate effort building a WordPress web site and have Facebook presence but this could be considered green field
