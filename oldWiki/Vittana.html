<strong>About</strong><br />
Vittana is an innovative tech-based non-profit and we are looking for developers who are just as creative as we are. The demand for Vittana student loans is huge and we need a dramatic increase in traffic to our crowd funded website to meet student needs. Think you have what it takes to create a killer app, unique strategy, game, widget, or feature to drive traffic? Then join our Give Camp team. Once completed, your project will be shared with our donors and board members, including tech greats like Hadi Partovi (former Microsoft’s Group Program Manager for Internet Explorer and co-founded Tellme Networks), Rich Barton (Expedia, Zillow) and other Seattle startup leaders.<br />
