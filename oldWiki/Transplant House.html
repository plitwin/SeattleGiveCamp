<span style="line-height: 1.5;">New website including a community forum and resources that allows past and current transplant patients to interact, share knowledge of the transplant process, and create a stronger transplant community. The transplant process is a difficult one full of information that people often &quot;don't know what they know&quot;. The only way they typically find this information is through other patients that have gone through it before or are going through it. We are in desperate need of a way to allow our patients to interact in a safe, comfortable environment.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Our website does not have a forum, and it is hard to update. We wish our website was in Wordpress. It is currently in ModX.<br />
Our current patient database that we work off of is in Microsoft Excel. It's very elementary, and each time we have a guest move i<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> I'd love our website to be in WordPress.<br />
Our patient database, it does not matter but it just must be user-friendly. Our Housing Director is not very technologically savvy but could be taught.
