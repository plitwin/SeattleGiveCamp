<strong>Work Request:</strong> We're hoping to develop an app that replicates our <em>Where to Turn for Teen</em> guides, so that youth in need of resources will be able to access the information they need right on their phones. Every year we distribute roughly 30,000 of these free printed guides. Obviously, the way teens communicate and access information has changed greatly in recent years and it would be wonderful to have this information available in the format youth are most comfortable using: an app they can access on their phones and tablets.<br />
To see the <em>Where to Turn for Teens</em> guide in PDF format, please visit:<br />

<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We do not currently have any other apps on the market. Our websites are in Wordpress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> No preference as to the technology, but we would prefer to be able to update the information in the app with some ease, as we will likely have limited technical support available. Our Peer Advisory Board has requested we start with an iPhone app if possible, and Android secondary.<br />
<br />
<strong>Notes:</strong> We already have branding--colors, logo and graphics available. Our graphic designer will be attending and will be prepared to resize graphics, create icons and buttons, etc as needed. (We are looking for a laptop to borrow.) We will have data for the resource guide exported and ready for import to app. (Any recommendations here appreciated.)<br />
<br />
Thank you!
