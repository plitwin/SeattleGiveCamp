<strong>Mission:</strong><br />
A voice and a hub for Latino community as we advocate on behalf of our people and work to achieve social justice<br />
<br />
<strong>Project:</strong><br />
&quot;We hope that Seattle GiveCamp can assist with one or both of these projects that will help build our capacity to promote our classes, fundraisers, events and volunteer opportunities; engage our current volunteers, donors and supporters; and develop new relationships to support the mission and work El Centro de la Raza does in the community.<br />
<br />
Project #1 (Priority) â€“ Mobile App/Mobile Website<br />
<br />
We understand that mobile internet access is quickly growing and that our website needs to be mobile ready. We are requesting volunteer to develop a mobile app/website for El Centro. We see an opportunity to engage with our current and new donors, volunteers and supporters via a mobile app or mobile website. We envision our volunteers learning about upcoming or hot, in-demand project volunteer opportunities on their phones, donors being able to make a pledge or donation quickly and easily, prospective donors and service providers being able to see what programs and services we provide, and our supporters being able to access a calendar of advocacy opportunities, classes, fundraisers, or events from anywhere. We are of course open to more creative ways to make El Centro mobile!<br />
Project #2 - Fundraising Web Pages<br />
<br />
Throughout the year El Centro de la Raza organizes and hosts a variety of fundraising events/classes, including but not limited to tamale-making and Spanish classes, Christmas tree sales, and an Annual Legacy Awards &amp; Auction Banquet. While we currently advertise our classes and events on the website, we do not have web pages dedicated to each class and event. We feel that individual event pages would be useful for both informational and promotional purposes, and would serve to make our fundraising events stand out there by leveraging resources to support our 33 programs and services.<br />
