<br />
<br />
They would like:<br />
<br />
<strong>Facebook App:</strong><br />
FB App that represents the core of what Get Schooled is (again - sizzle and substance), bringing celebrity inspiration directly to students and then asking students to share their own educational inspiration. We know that students follow celebs, are heavily influenced by them, and want to be inspired. We also know that youth want to be a part of a conversation - not just talked at. This app would do all of this.<br />
<br />
We envision a FB app with a photo and testimonial/quote underneath, explaining the motivating reason why someone 'Gets Schooled.' Then users would be told to share their own story of why they get schooled. A form would let them respond to the prompt, &quot;I get schooled because...&quot; - and they'd be able to upload a photo, share the stories, etc. They'd have to accept terms and conditions of course. Get Schooled would tie this into our editorial calendar, twitter conversation, etc.<br />
<br />
In the end, we would have more youth engaged in their education and inspired to stay focused - and hopefully we'd create a great archive of celebs and kids talking about why school matters.Our specific goals follow.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">Goals:</span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Youth find a new channel to engage with GS and their friends around education </span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- GS programs can use this tool to help promote specific activities (kids recognizing great teachers, celebrity-inspired contests, etc)</span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Youth have a new way to express themselves on education, share their thoughts and 'be famous'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">The experience will live on Facebook where it can be fangated to increase the network. The app would be a photo mosaic that allows users to upload photos with messages that can be repurposed for a number of different things based on content calendar and programmatic needs</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">Experience: </span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Students upload a photo of themselves and a response to a text prompt (i.e., I get schooled because, what are you thankful for, why is education important to you, send a holiday message to your friends, etc.) </span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Their post is uploaded to a mosaic of images and quotes that is dynamic and constantly changes/rotates. (think </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iam.beyonce.com/" rel="nofollow">http://iam.beyonce.com/</a>)<br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Students are then allowed to share their post and tell their friends to post their own response.</span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- Responses could be submitted through Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram (app will scrap against a specific hashtag) </span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- For Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, student would have to upload the photo and their quote and use the required hashtag in the post</span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- All responses will be moderated </span><br />
<span style="color: #1f497d;">- App can scrap data of students if they allow the app to do that, or we require email address to participate to eliminate the need for students to have to approve the app (like we did with Offerpop)</span><br />
