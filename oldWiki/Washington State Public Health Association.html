<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Project:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">We would like to harness the power of social media to spread our message about the importance of public health. We believe that improving our social media effectiveness will help us grow our public health community and increase our impact. In particular, we would like to use social media (facebook and twitter) to educate people on important public health issues (e.g. emergency preparedness, healthy eating, communicable disease), on the importance of the public health system to our communities and to incite action on policy issues. We are also interested in utilizing linkedin to strengthen connections between people working in public health, ideally to encourage discussion on important issues and sharing of professional resources.<br />
<br />
Currently, WSPHA has a facebook page and is working on a strategic marketing plan. As a small organization with a volunteer Board of DIrectors and a staff of one, we would benefit from expert advise and guidance on how to use of social media more effectively and in the features of social media (e.g. hashtags).</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">About:</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif; font-size: 19.2px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Washington State Public Health Association (WSPHA), is a statewide membership organization for public health professionals and supporters. Established in 1935, it is one of the oldest affiliates of the American Public Health Association.<br />
<br />
We believe all Washington residents deserve an equal opportunity for positive health outcomes. To achieve this, we need a strong public health system to protect all people in Washington, their families and their communities from preventable, serious health threats and to advance community-based health promotion and disease prevention. Our goal is to create a public health movement in Washington.</span><br />
