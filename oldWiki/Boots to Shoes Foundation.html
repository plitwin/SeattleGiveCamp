<br />
<strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Work Request:</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Boots to Shoes Foundation has had a donated website for several years. We are currently trying to facelift and update the website to a template (wordpress) that will allow us to make updates without involving or having to pay a technical resource every time we want to add an event or new information</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We have drafted a new wordpress website, however our volunteer assistance does not have the technical capability to finish and launch the website. It is hosted on godaddy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We have drafted most of the site on Wordpress. Since we do not have technical capability, we are not sure that some of the issues we have encountered are the result of the limited experience of our volunteer (not previously familiar with wordpress, learning as they go), or limited by wordpress itself.
