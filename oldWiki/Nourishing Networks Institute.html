 <br />
Primary audiences:<br />
• People who volunteer within the five local Nourishing Networks.<br />
• Potential funders of NNI<br />
<br />
Potentially included in the site:<br />
• Overview of the Nourishing Networks history, vision, mission, philosophy and academic basis.<br />
• “About Us” section for staff, board, etc.<br />
• General information about each local Nourishing Network to help new and potential volunteers connect with the network and projects in their community.<br />
• Blog site and/or updatable section for local Nourishing Networks to highlight their work – possibly through a link with Facebook or other social media site.<br />
• Sample/model tools that local volunteer leaders can use to support the Nourishing Network in their community, e.g., “Getting Started” or “Volunteer Toolkit”<br />
• Upload site for documents, web resources, and other items that members of the local Nourishing Networks would like to share with one another.<br />
• Repository of services, technical assistance, volunteer manpower, and other items than have been “placed on offer” to people who are connected with the local Nourishing Networks. (Including items offered by people and organizations in the Regional Resource Network)<br />
• Discussion board with ability for site visitors to create and join discussion threads – possibly through a link with Facebook or other social media site.<br />
• E-newsletter or other “sign-up” function. Possibly connected with a CRM such as Salesforce.com and/or communication tool such as Constant Contact.<br />
• Volunteer opportunities and/or other “asks” (or a “wish list”) for NNI-specific issues, possibly integrated with a similar function for each of the local Nourishing Networks.<br />
Other important parameters:<br />
• There is no technical support staff at NNI so the site must be simple to maintain. A straightforward CMS will be critical<br />
• Most of the non-static content will be updated by members of the local Nourishing Networks, therefore, ease of use and robust infrastructure will be important. It is possible (or likely) that the best way to allow the functionality would be through integrating the site with an existing social media tool like Facebook.<br />
• NNI would prefer to have a well-functioning, simple to maintain site with a limited number of items from the “Potentially Included list” to getting all of the potentially included items but with a site that requires professional maintenance.<br />
• NNI team members can develop content for site pages.<br />
