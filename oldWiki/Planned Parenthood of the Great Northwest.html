Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest's Peer Education Institute is looking for an app for both iPhone and Android phones that will allow teen peer educators to track their one-on-one contacts. Tracking peer educators one-on-one contacts using a smartphone app is more teen-friendly and immediate, making it more likely that we will receive accurate data. The data recorded using a teenâ€™s cell phone needs to be collated into a centralized database, which also needs to be developed. The data logged from the phone app will need to be accessible to our evaluation team and educators to tally hours spent for each individual peer educator on one-on-one contacts. We estimate that between 150- 200 teens will be using this application to log data over the next year. In additional years, this number is likely to increase.<br />
<br />
We envision the app to be teen-friendly, colorful and fun, while also collecting this important data. Teens need to be able to enter data quickly, which will include their ID number (ideally this will be saved), date of contact, duration from a drop-down menu, and topic code from a drop-down menu with 10 choices. We would also like the capability of adding additional questions in the future and changing choices in drop-down menus.<br />

The Peer Education Institute or PEI (find us at peereducationinstitute.org) is part of the Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest (PPGNW) Education team. The PEI project is standardizing, replicating, and evaluating the long-standing peer education program, Teen Council. Part of the evaluation of the Teen Council program is to measure the reach and impact of the peer educators, which includes the informal conversations they have with their peers about important sexual health topics, like STD testing, relationships, birth control methods, and pregnancy options. Currently we measure these using a paper form, where peer educators record the date, duration and topic of each contact. We don't believe this current method is the most user-friendly or most accurate way to measure these important one-on-one contacts.<br />

 <br />
In order to maximize end-user compatibility while leverage the team's existing talent, we decided to implement an ASP.NET MVC 4 web app using responsive CSS design. The web app is a user-friendly front-end for peer educators to quickly and accurately log their one-on-one contacts into a database, from which an administrator can generate reports. This app simplifies the collection and reporting process making the entire workflow more efficient.
