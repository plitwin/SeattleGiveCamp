<strong>Work Request:</strong> Advocacy Tool and Trip Tracker<br />
<br />
We have two projects that support our advocacy and promoting walking throughout the region.<br />
<br />
The first tool is create a way for to people petition and pledge to a cause. We want to ensure that people have access to the Link Light Rail stations and we have created a campaign called <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.feetfirst.org/what-we-do/advocacy-qa/sound-access" rel="nofollow">Sound Access for All</a> . We are building a movement and need to show politicians that everybody walks, and the basic right of walking has been built out of our communities. Feet First is at the forefront of changing the conversation.<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Verdana,'Bitstream Vera Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We would like to have created a way for people to enter their names and contact information and opt in to hear more about our progressâ€”and then store and report on this data on our Salesforce database. We want petition customization by state and city legislative district for different campaigns. For example on the campaign we are focusing on getting funding for a pedestrian bridge to cross I-5. We need to reach Sound Transit, City, County and State board and legislators respectively to let them know their constituents are in favor of having safe, easy, and inviting access to the stations. </span><br />
<br />
The second campaign tool is to create a trip logging program for WALKTOBER campaign (in October of 2015). This campaign will be the umbrella for Walk to School &amp; Walk to Work campaigns. We would like to creatively engage youth and adults to walk. We currently do not have a system to track the number of trips and miles taken by people walking to work and to school. We want to develop a fun, easy to use application that invites people to creatively engage in the exploration of walking through design. We have used in the past <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.luum.com/challenges/27/walk2more-challenge" rel="nofollow">LUUM</a>. This technology is too expensive, lacks customizing to look like our <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.feetfirst.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> and does not allow us access to the participants to continue to build a relationship with them in our other programs. We would like to ensure our programs support each other. 75 percent of trips kids take today are done in a car, we would like to use WALKTOBER for people to find a new way to explore an old way of getting around. We believe this fun competitive environment can support a walking culture.<br />
<br />
Our intention is to encourage people to challenge themselves, hundreds of employees &amp; companies around the city to track trips (to and from work and portion of the commute) and miles. Participants are encouraged to recognize how design plays an important role in great walking experiences and support pedestrian safety and accessibility in Seattle. We would like for there to be individual tracking and leader board to create teams and track trips/miles against other schools and companies.<br />
