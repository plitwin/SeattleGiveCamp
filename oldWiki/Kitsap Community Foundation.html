 <span style="font-size: 14px;">We have several options. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Website</strong>. Priority #1 would be making our website mobile-ready. We have been following the trends and know that an increasing number of donors, nonprofits and constituents are using <u>[[#|mobile devices]]</u> to access websites. We would also want an easy ‘Donate Now’ service within the mobile site. Priority </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Redesign</strong> of our existing website. We explored a website re-design using Charity Advantage and decided against it as it was limited with some of the plug-ins including calendar, blog, <u>[[#|newsletter email]]</u> integration. In January 2012, the board of directors recently upgraded the website, but we are still using Paypal integration and it's rather clunky. While the content is good, we have ideas to simplify our current <u>[[#|Content Management System]]</u> and would love a better integrated payment system both for donations and events. We would also love a solution that would capture form data (we use event <u>[[#|registration]]</u> as well as donor information) and automatically filter that into a back-end database, rather than always just manually enter. We would love a better blog feature. We are active on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and it would be great to get those features shared on the website if appropriate. We currently have the links, but not active feed. 2. General technology evaluation. We currently have 4 <u>[[#|computers]]</u> on the system, use <u>[[#|Dropbox]]</u> for some <u>[[#|file sharing]]</u>, and some PC based shared networks. We would love to explore systems for staff collaboration (similar, but not necessarily BaseCamp). We are a <u>[[#|small office]]</u> and several of us work remotely at times. We would want to ensure our system is as optimized as possible. We anticipate continued growth at Kitsap Community Foundation and know that if our system is running smoothly, it will accommodate future growth. We utilize our TechSoup membership regularly.</span></li></ol><br />

<strong>About</strong><br />
We have a newer staff. We are planning an online day of giving May 6, 2014 called the Kitsap Great Give. Similar to The Seattle Foundation's Give Big, we hope to raise at least $500,000 for area nonprofits. We are also embarking on a Community Engagement Process to explore how to address Inter-generational Poverty which will include regranting funds to area nonprofits thanks to the initiative of a large, well know foundation located in Seattle. We are doing great things and need some <u>[[#|technical assistance]]</u> to mobilize our website<br />

<strong>2013 Seattle Give Camp Project</strong><br />
<br />
After much discussion, analyzing the current <u>[[#|CMS system]]</u> and structure, we decided to veer from our original plan and work on <u>[[#|Wordpress]]</u> migration. This will allow for the mobile capability our organization was hoping for. We upgraded our design with new logo and updated color scheme. We will <u>[[#|continue]]</u> to team on the final integration of the project.<br />
