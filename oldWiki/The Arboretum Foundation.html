<strong>Work Request:</strong> The Arboretum Foundation wants to have a presence on mobile devices in order to facilitate learning about the Arboretum while in the midst of the park. We would like to develop an Android app that has three main functions: providing news and current events from the foundation, serving as an interactive guide to the Arboretum itself, and giving users the opportunity to donate to the foundation.<br />
It is important to us that we will be able to update this app once it has been completed, so an app that we can change the content of with little training is essential.<br />
We are hoping that the news feed on the app can come directly from twitter in order to reduce the amount of content that must be generated to keep the feed fresh.<br />
Ideally the guide portion of the app would be an interactive map with touchable nodes that would bring up information about the various parts of the Arboretum.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We run Windows 7 on all of our computers and we use a cloud based server. We also have a few Verizon Ellipsis tablets which are running the latest version of Jelly Bean. Our current credit card processing service is Authorize.net.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We would like to be able to continue to use Android, but if the app could be developed for both apple os and android and could still be edited on a windows machine, that would be ideal.
