<strong>Work Request:</strong> We would like to enhance the look and capabilities of our current website. Seattle Neighborhood Greenways is a rapidly growing volunteer coalition representing many neighborhoods across Seattle who plan and advocate for safe, equitable, and comfortable streets connecting us to the places we use.<br />
<br />
We represent over 20 neighborhoods working on safe street and infrastructure projects and each of these has a page on our site but it is not easy for them to update the content<br />
We like to have a lot maps, and resources available for people who come to our site and it would be great for there to be an interactive component where folks could leave their thoughts about the streets in their neighborhoods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We have a website that is currently in word press <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://seattlegreenways.org/" rel="nofollow">http://seattlegreenways.org/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> Word Press would be good for us to continue to use
