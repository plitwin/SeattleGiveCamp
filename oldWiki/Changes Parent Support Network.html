<strong>Contact:</strong> Terri Suzuki<br />
<br />
<strong>Needed:</strong> Wordpress and design<br />
<br />
<strong>About:</strong><br />
Changes Parent Support Network needs a new website to help us grow and serve more parents. We provide free support and education to parents of teens and young adults who are making bad choices. We provide free weekly support groups, support at court or school and educational seminars.<br />
<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> Our current website was designed in Dreamweaver and is not very friendly as well as a pain to change in any sort of way.<br />
<br />
We would like to use <strong>Wordpress</strong> and have a site that not only helps spread the knowledge of our group but is useful for our members.<br />
We want members to be able to log in and download information.<br />
We also need to have a module that will allow group leaders to upload attendance and volunteer hours.<br />
With Wordpress we can more easily interface with <strong>social media</strong> which is very hard right now.<br />
Wordpress also will allow us to change the &quot;blog&quot; area at will if we have a big event or a seminar that we want to highlight. Right now it is just a dead-end site that is very unfriendly to use and to view.<br />
<br />
<strong>PM Notes:</strong><br />
Terri has an auction on Saturday. She will not be able to attend that day. She will have her Ipad with her and will be able to approve comps through that on Saturday.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Dreamweaver running on NewTek<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We want to use Wordpress because of its ease of use, ability to give groups control of their pages without disrupting style sheets and branding. Several staff members and myself have experience with Wordpress.
