<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Project: Housing Consortium of Everett &amp; Snohomish County, website and server issues</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong><br />
Move six HTML pages to a new site in Wordpress. Upload some Office files to the cloud.<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Website help. I want to be able to update our website myself. Currently, we have to pay an outside vendor because I do not have the knowledge or skill (HTML, etc) to maintain our website. It is my understanding that there are website templates which, when built, can easily be updated and maintained by non-tech staff. Someone told me it is similar to typing a Word document and then simply pasting the updates into the template. I like the current layout and style of our website, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.housingsnohomish.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.housingsnohomish.org</a>, but want to be able to maintain it myself</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Our company server is old and at capacity. I would like (I think) to transfer our files to the cloud and discontinue use of our server.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">About:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">The Housing Consortium of Everett &amp; Snohomish County is a 501(c)3 that works on affordable housing policies and funding in Snohomish County and partners with other organizations statewide.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> We currently have only one staff person, Mark Smith, the Executive Director.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Team Members:</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Matt Perry</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Danny Ly</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Gerald Kwong</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">What We Accomplished:</span></strong><br />
<strong>Project 1:</strong> Matt, Ryan and Ian set up a website using Wordpress. They transferred the contents of the old website, which was entirely done in HTML code, to the new website retaining the same look and very similar structure. The casual visitor to the new site will probably not notice any difference. The difference for Mark as the staff responsible for updating the website is enormous. Whereas previously he needed to pay an outside vendor for even the most simple updates, he can now log into his Wordpress site and make those edits similar to the way he would edit a Word document. This is a huge cost and time saving to his organization.<br />
<br />
<strong>Project 2:</strong> Danny, Emily and Gerald took on the task of making the server unneccessary to the operation of the Housing Consortium. This was critical to the ongoing operation of the organization as the server was old and increasingly unreliable. In order to do this, they transferred all of the information stored on the server to an external hard drive. This was a difficult task as in their own words, &quot;They had never seen a server and cartridge tape back-up device like this and it was definitely weird!&quot; They set up a cloud storage/file synchronization account with Barracuda with 15GB of free storage. They also set up an Outlook.com email account as all Consortium email accounts were tied in with the old server.<br />
<br />
Both teams left detailed instructions with Housing Consortium staff on the operation of the new systems. Mark estimates that successful completion of these two tasks will annually save the Consortium $1,000-$2,000 in IT consulting and website maintenance fees. Of equal importance is the increased functionality and efficiency for Consortium staff as they can now update their own website content easily and as needed, and access their email and documents from any computer with internet connection.
