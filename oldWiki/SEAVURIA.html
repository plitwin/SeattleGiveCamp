<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Project:</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Our organization is ready to expand our offerings but in order to fundraise, we need to improve our website. Our current website does not adequately describe our work. It has been pieced together by good-hearted volunteers but this cobbling together does not share our story, it does not challenge the reader to join our efforts. We need to <strong>clean up the site</strong>, to prioritize the necessary elements and make it easy for visitors to navigate and find what speaks to their soul. We need a professional to guide us through the process. This would be an amazing opportunity to gain this help and move us forward. We would also like to set up a Facebook interface to help expand our message. We need help setting up that page and help to know what to expect and how to manage it.</span><br />

 The first step in the project was re-mapping the website content to appeal to the various audiences that would be visiting the site. Once the content areas had been established, the navigation elements were set in and the new pages were created.<br />
<br />
Existing content was heavily edited and re-written to better reflect upon the organization and what they do.<br />
<br />
The home page was completely re-done to be more effective in communicating the mission of the organization. The script-heavy image slider was removed in order to better facilitate slower connections found at the Kenyan schools. A new four-column layout was applied to showcase the different groups participating in the SeaVuria project.<br />
<br />
A secondary navigation bar was implemented to improve website usability.<br />
<br />
New graphics were implemented for social media buttons and donate buttons. Google maps was used to help display the schools involved in the program and give visitors a sense of place.<br />
<br />
Because of the type of content being used in the website, a new approach of displaying information using post categories was implemented. As new projects are added to the site, they will display on a post page of the relevant category. The structuring of the categories helps focus the site and prevent large volumes of &quot;misc&quot; posts that were cluttering the site before.<br />
<br />
Post thumbnails were better styled to reflect their containing information. As SeaVuria has produced numerous project videos, posts with videos will be displayed with an indicator to help guide visitors interested in that content.<br />
