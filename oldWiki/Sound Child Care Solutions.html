<strong>Project:</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: left;">Sound Child Care Solutions is proposing the <strong>development of am ASP.Net website portal database</strong> for the collection and reporting of professional development information capable of supporting over 130 staff across seven centers.<br />
<br />
Sound Child Care Solutions offers an integrated approach to professional development to pay deeper attention to the teaching and learning process, beyond just meeting standards. As an anti-bias, non-racist organization, we also must bring staff deeper to Undoing Institutional Racism themselves, as we recognize we cannot effectively serve children and families unless we are working together with them to address the ways racism impacts us all. All staff are formally trained and in continual dialogue and action in undoing institutional racism. Directors can focus on educational quality so we exceed national standards such as the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) or National Administrator Credential (NAC). As a result of our high quality centers, our staff have been featured in Exchange magazine and are often invited to speak at conferences about shared services and achieving positive outcomes for children in non-traditional, progressive centers. Our children reflect the quality of our centers with excellent outcomes. In 2010-2011, 94% of children in SCCS centers reached or surpassed their developmental milestones. Among Pre-K children, our results were even better: 97% had the motor, social/emotional, literacy and cognitive skills our school district says they need for kindergarten.<br />
<br />
At the present time, our outcomes are noteworthy, but much of our data collection remains in note form. In order to support the growth of our centers, we must continually improve our efficiency.<br />
<br />
Through the generous support of the Seattle GiveCamp, <strong>Sound Child Care Solutions envisions a website</strong> <strong>portal database</strong> that is simple in design in order to encourage the use by various technology levels of our staff and sustainable in structure in order to enable growth of its capabilities for generating reports and basic summary statistics. The database would allow center directors to input information about professional development activities and trainings for staff, college courses to further their degree attainment, certification and expiration dates for items necessary for center licensing (i.e., CPR, First Aid), and etc. With a few key strokes, directors and professional development staff will be able to access a matrix of information to identify which staff are approaching deadlines for trainings and credential requirements. This would enable the consortium to inform, organize and register staff in a timely manner and ensure that centers have appropriate coverage from substitute/on-call center “relief” staff. For working staff currently enrolled in college or college-credit bearing courses, navigating the college graduation process may appear overwhelming. The accessibility of information collected in this database will also enable the consortium to focus efforts on supporting staff who may need assistance connecting to college advisers and ensuring their success in the completion of their degree program.<br />

Closing Statements<br />
<br />
In the end, we intend to look back on the efforts of the consortium as mindful, forward thinking and always with the children and families we serve at the core of our success. As a shared services consortium, we rely greatly on volunteers, partner agencies and the generous support of organizations such as Seattle GiveCamp to help us connect families to the resources and information that will further their healthy development and well being. We thank you for your time and consideration of our proposal and look forward to this opportunity to partner with Seattle GiveCamp.</span><br />

<br />
Since 2006, Sound Child Care Solutions has taken the lead in the region and even nationally, by implementing shared services in an early learning context throughout King County. SCCS is a consortium of seven child care centers who have joined together to share the business operations and professional development side of child care while each keeping the individual center’s own name and community identity. By sharing costs, we can spend less money on administration and more on children and families, allowing us to improve educational quality and serve more low income children. Together we can afford more sophisticated resources to solve problems, improve our workplaces, and strengthen our communities. We maintain and are nationally recognized for an unwavering commitment toward improved access to quality centers for both families and educators of color as well as an organization-wide commitment to undoing institutional racism.The shared services model has helped us pursue our core goal of building culturally relevant, anti-bias practice into classrooms and professional development, and with families, staff and board. Currently, nine of our 23 classrooms are dual language with Spanish, Vietnamese, or Somali with English. With over 130 teachers and administrators living out those commitments, our collaborative values are: Engaged Learning, Joyful Work, Social Justice, Shared Accountability, Intentional Practice, and Sustainable Community. Weaving our gifts, we nurture teachers and directors so children can thrive.<br />
