I don't. I don't see where I can acquire access 2007 or office 2007 products.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAm I the only one with this problem?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIs there anyway we can come up with a solution to this.  Does anyone have an old installation CD that we can pass around or something so that we can be productive in the tool of choice?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI went ahead and sent an email to Paul suggesting that this may be an issue to see if he could come up with a solution for us.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nYou can contact me at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlEmailRule:10:batainer@gmail.com --><a class=\"wiki_link_ext\" href=\"mailto:batainer@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">batainer@gmail.com<\/a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlEmailRule:10 --><br \/>\n<br \/>\nBetsy (flannel shirt and reading glasses)","replies":[]}
