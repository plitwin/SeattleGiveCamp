There are 4 tools (I don't recall the names).  Each tool measure some certain criteria (my word, I don't remember hers) or group of criteria.  Each tool can specify different measures for the criteria that it measures.  ie tool #1 might measure criteria 'a' as being skills normal for an age group of say 6-8 years, while tool #2 might measure criteria 'a' (same criteria, or identifier, or benchmark, remember, my word) using age groups or standards with different groupings say 5-10 which would not be an appropriate response if tool #1 were used.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLooks like we'll need a table defining appropriate responses for the given tool used. That table might also identify the approprate measures for the given tool. Or the form may only show appropriate criteria as well as responses for a given tool.","replies":[]}
