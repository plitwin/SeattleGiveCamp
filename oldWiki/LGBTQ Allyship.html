<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong><br />
We would like to have our website re-designed. We would like to increase the useability of our website, better integrate our social media to our site and have the ability to have rotating pictures of our latest programming on our first page.<br />
<br />
Our website was not designed to best utilize search engine optimization. Because the one of the best ways to connect with LGBTQ communities is online - having an attractive, user-friendly, SEO-effective website is desired to increase our reach to current and future constituents.<br />
<br />
Ensuring our website is mobile friendly, as well as friendly to different sizes of screens.<br />
<br />
Lastly, using WordPress or another software that is easily editable is desired for website content maintenance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We use WordPress for our website.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> I am familiar with Wordpress but if there is another web design software that is more user-friendly and easily editable I am open to other technology.
