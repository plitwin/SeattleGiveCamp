<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: left;">There are a few key updates I would like to make to our website that would allow it to be <strong>more functional, easier to maintain, and more dynamic</strong>. Our website was overhauled in June of 2012. With a limited budget and incredibly short timeline, a developer built the existing site (www.llaa.org) using <strong>Drupal 6</strong>. Our goal when we did the website overhaul was to make it easy for current and potential clients to access information on our programs. The website at the time was a disaster – very outdated design, architecture, and content. Now, my goal with the website has changed. Clients are not the primary audience for our site. Most searched words are “volunteer”, “thrift store”, whatever event we have coming up, “jobs” and “Chicken Soup Brigade” (the latter is our food program). I would like to gradually grow our site to include a “for Lifelong clients” section that includes eligibility requirements and program information. Then, the bulk of the site would include inspiring client and volunteer program, event and volunteer information, agency news, and advocacy information. I think we can start to do this in a few ways. We have an opportunity to use the homepage banner to promote events, campaigns, and powerful messages and photography, but it is not currently being used in that capacity. Reference the banner on San Francisco AIDS Foundation’s site. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sfaf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfaf.org/</a><br />
<br />
We are pushing content on <strong>Facebook and Instagram</strong> but it is not <strong>integrated onto our website.</strong> Overall integration between all of our channels – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, newsletters, and the website, is weak. There is SO much great content on our social channels that is worth sharing on our website. I don't think we even have the ability to embed videos on our site. Having this feature would be ideal.<br />
<br />
Our homepage is difficult to maintain because the articles on the homepage require frequent updates. The way in which they are presented – short paragraph teasers that link through to complete articles – make it time consuming to update because of the length and depth of content. Rather, I would prefer the homepage include more photos and links and fewer “articles” and treat news as short links in a “What’s New” section. See how Cascade AIDS (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cascadeaids.org/" rel="nofollow">http://cascadeaids.org/</a>) or Chicago AIDS (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aidschicago.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aidschicago.org/</a>) does this. This would allow us to share the abundance of information we have at our fingertips, from HIV testing locations to client profiles to a call for volunteers to press releases. I have a difficult time making homepage information current and timely. News articles do not include dates.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Lifelong produces four signature events each year and participates in dozens of third-party events (drag shows, happy hours). These events are buried on our site. Ideally, we would have a content area on our homepage devoted to events, similar to what Los Angeles AIDS Project does (check out their “Get Involved” section <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apla.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apla.org/</a>).<br />
<br />
I believe these changes will start to satisfy the needs of our web visitors, make the site easier to maintain, and make our agency more relevant. With more dynamic content and a clear path to get involved with Lifelong, I believe we will take advantage of a HUGE opportunity standing before us – educating people about the cause and getting them to participate in the work that we do. By staying current and relevant vis a vis more news and calls-to-action on our site, we present ourselves as staying on top of the needs of the HIV/AIDS community thereby priming us for ongoing financial investment from the community. All of this, while still providing information to our clients about the programs we offer.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reviewing this proposal. I am REALLY excited at this opportunity and hope I can work with you guys!</span><br />

SCCS Seattle GiveCamp Application Proposal<br />
<br />
Imagine a community of teacher-learners where children come first, their families are important, and children from all economic backgrounds have an opportunity to participate in a wonderful learning environment. Imagine an organization where education, children, efficient business practices are smoothly interwoven and are of equal priority. Imagine a non-profit where the use of technology and cutting edge business tools free funds to continue improving the quality of early learning. This is Sound Child Care Solutions. Together with the support of Seattle GiveCamp, we can positively impact the professional growth of our Early Childhood Education community and the healthy developmental growth of disproportionally effected young children for generations to come.<br />
