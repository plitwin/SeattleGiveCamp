<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Project:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We would like to have a website updated with the following capacity if possible:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Online registration system that can take information that meets our grant data collection needs, keep confidentiality, and registration fee when needed, also will link to our data base software if possible.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Online application form for volunteers that can be linked to our volunteer data base system.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Reorganize our information and resource pages. Make it easier for people to navigate and search for needed resources and information.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">A website easy for someone who don’t have Technology training to post and update news or messages, such as workshop announcement, news happen with our organizations, etc.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">A website has access to parent training video clips along with training materials, also has the function to know who take the training and a communication box for them to fill out evaluation/feedback form.</span></li></ul><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Background:</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The mission of our organization, Open Doors for Multicultural Families, is to ensure that diverse families who have family members with developmental disabilities and special health care needs have equal access to culturally and linguistically appropriate information, resources, and services. We promote culturally competent services through community collaboration, training and partnerships. The organization was formed in June, 2009 by a diverse group of passionate parents of children with disabilities and professionals who care about people with disabilities and valued community volunteers after their collaborative work together for more than a decade.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Since then, we have grown from one full time volunteer position to one full time and seven part-time staff who are either bilingual or multilingual. Through 20+ languages spoken by our staff and volunteer board members, we were able to provide linguistically and culturally responsive services to more than 400 families of children with disabilities in 2012, 10 times increased in the number of family we serve since 2009. Majority of these immigrant and refugee families are low income, living in South Seattle and South King County where school districts have 100+ different languages spoken by their students’ families.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Over the past 4 years, Open Doors’ linguistically and culturally responsive services have been proven needed and valuable to our target population. Our quality services have resulted in many grant awards from recognizable funders, such as United Way of King County, Seattle Foundation, City of Seattle, Seattle People’s Fund, Office of Special Education Program of Federal Government and Washington State Attorney General’s Office.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> As a new organization, growing rapidly in the past 4 years, from 1 staff in 2009 to 8 staff in 2013, we are in need of changing our current website to meet our growth needs. Currently, we conduct 15+ parent training workshops and family events in various languages annually. On average, each parent workshop we have 30-40 participants and more than 180 people attend each inclusive family event, including many valuable community volunteers. Handling registrations by papers have been time consuming for our staff. Also, we are planning to meet with more families’ training needs by posting training video clips on our website, or create webinar for families who aren’t able to attend face to face training. Because we are serving multicultural and multilingual families, we have plenty resources available in different languages. We would like to get them all organized in a way that is easy for navigation and topical search.</span><br />

<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">1. Added live-translation features<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> using Google API for any page. By adding the shorthand code [google-translator] to any post or page, a dropdown menu will be created which allows the user to select from a wide variety of languages to which the page could be translated. This even </span>translates<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> text in dropdown menus on the page. The translation seems to work pretty well in Hindi, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese, but we have not yet done user-testing with speakers of other languages</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Added Gravity Forms to the website, which provides powerful tools for creating virtually any form imaginable. This also allows page admins to see a lost of all submissions to a form, and even download the data in a format readable by Microsoft Excel (.csv).</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Rehosted website on discountasp.net, at the URL </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sgcwordpre1.web803.discountasp.net/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">http://sgcwordpre1.web803.discountasp.net/wordpress/</a> which is faster and cheaper than the old host. There were problems transferring data related to the plugins on the old site, so events and staff data were unable to be transferred. That will need to be done manually.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong>Changes To be made in week(s) following:</strong><br />
<br />
We need to point multiculturalfamilies.org to the location of the new website at <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sgcwordpre1.web803.discountasp.net/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">http://sgcwordpre1.web803.discountasp.net/wordpress/</a></span> once it is ready. Paul has said that he is available to help do that.<br />
<br />
Vivek (vivekkparam@gmail.com) will meet with Open Doors later to help demonstrate the changes made to the website and how they are useful.<br />
