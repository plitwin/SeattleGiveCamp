<strong>Work Request:</strong> We would like to create a new website with updated look and functionality. Our present site is in Dreamweaver, and we have found the training required is too expensive and time-consuming. As a result, we have only one part-time staff member who is only partially able to work in Dreamweaver, resulting in a website that is somewhat staid and we are very limited in what we can do with it. For example, we want social media icons and a donate button at the top of the website, but she does not know how to do that. We were hoping we could create a site using a content management system that is user friendly and intuitive so that more than one staff member can be cross-trained to update the site. We'd like to have features like scrolling photos from our events that can easily be updated, twitter feed, a tag cloud, and embedded videos to add interest and make the site more engaging - and we need to make the site mobile device friendly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We use Dreamweaver Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 on a server running Windows Small Business Server 2008.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We had a volunteer create a website for us in Joomla that was very engaging and had the features we wanted, including a user friendly and intuitive maintenance framework, but he didn't finish the job before moving out of the area, so we never made the transition.
