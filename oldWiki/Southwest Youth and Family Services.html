<span style="font-size: 14px;">In 2012, GiveCamp worked with SWYFS to create a new website, using <strong>WordPress</strong>. We are very happy with this website and find it flexible and easy to maintain.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> However, because another organization, New Futures, has merged with SWYFS, we need to also <strong>merge the content</strong> of the SWYFS website and the New Futures website into one cohesive site. The website needs to appropriately represent New Futures as a program of SWYFS while presenting an accurate vision of the organization as a whole. The visuals and images of the website need to be consistent across all programs including New Futures'.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> The merger has also necessitated a change in mission statement, which must be reflected in the website; we need to figure out how to present all programs as different approaches to the same goal: creating communities were families thrive and prosper.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> The website needs to be refreshed to make it more appealing and more useful to potential donors, to increase its utility as a fundraising tool.</span><br />

Summary of Project:<br />
<br />
Over the past 3 days swyfs.org has been changed drastically. The previous website was text heavy, contained minimal photos and content on certain pages that had not been updated in months. Our goal was to restructure the website, make the site more user friendly and appealing, rewrite and edit content, and make it such that the website reflected SWYFS's recent merger with another nonprofit organization, New Futures.<br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Our first task was to restructure the website. We did so by removing links that had resided on the top, bottom, and side bar, and putting them solely on the top bar with a drop down menu. By doing so, we uncluttered each webpage and made it much easier to navigate for both donors and </span>individuals<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> that utilize the services and programs offered by SWYFS. </span></li><li>Our second task was to make the site more user friendly and appealing. We first added photos. Photos as many people might say, &quot;Speak a thousand words&quot;. SWYFS had numerous photos taken during youth programs and of classes offered at their facilities, that had not been added to the website. By adding photos we could let a visitor to the website connect a program, class, or service, to a face of someone that had experienced it.</li><li>Our third task was to rewrite and edit content. The previous website was filled with valuable information on everything about SWYFS. But much of the content could and was cut down and revised to make it easier to read. We identified the main audience of the website as current and possible donors of SWYFS. By targeting the website's main audience, we tailored the content in the website to carry out the mission of the organization throughout the entire website.</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Our fourth task was to reflect the recent merger between SWYFS and New Futures. We did this by adding a link to a content page about the programs that New Futures offers and what areas in Seattle and King county those are offered in. </span></li></ul><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">While the website cannot go live yet, SWYFS will slowly be making the transition to the new website over the next few months. So stay tuned! </span><br />
