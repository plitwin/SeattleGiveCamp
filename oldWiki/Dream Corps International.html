<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> We are a nonprofit organization that helps to build libraries in rural area in China.<br />
For the GiveCamp, we'd like to build a web application for donors to donate books, track their books, and check the usage of their donated books. This way, we can keep donors more involved and aware of what their impact is so we could have more recurring donations as well as keeping a good donor relationship.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We are currently running Ruby on Rails with MySQL DB for our web applications. It's on a Linux Server<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> Yes. We'd like some technology that is easy for us to take over after the camp. For example, Angular JS is good for us. while Net framework is not an optimal choice for us.<br />
Good ones: Angular JS, Node.js, JSP, J2EE.
