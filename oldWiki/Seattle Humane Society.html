<strong>Work Request:</strong> Seattle Humane Society runs three community outreach programs called Pet Project, for pets owned by low-income people with cancer and those who are disabled by HIV/AIDs, Pet Food Bank serving low-income seniors and our Visiting Pet Friends program, which sends Seattle Humane Society volunteers and their certified pets to visit seniors and people with disabilities in retirement homes and health care facilities throughout King County. We are searching for a multifunctional database that can help organize 25 years of past records, track veterinary care and health information for pets, contact and health information on our clients, track volunteers and visit locations for these programs. In addition to the data and reporting needs, it’d be great to have a database that could hold photos of our clients and their pets, bio information about our clients, relationship connections between records, and maybe even prompt an outreach call or email with a popup on certain records to continue building relationships.<br />
<br />
This year we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of Pet Project and committed to keeping the program running for many more years to come. Part of the program provides free basic veterinary care to the pets of clients. At these clinics, pets receive free wellness exams, routine vaccinations, flea medications and basic veterinary care for medical issues that arise. Pet Project also identifies a Seattle Humane Society volunteer to make monthly pet food and supply deliveries to clients and their pets at home. There are over 250 pets in the program and we are accepting 3-5 new clients each month. In May 2014, we opened Pet Project up to low-income people with cancer and are looking for an updated and functional database to accommodate this new community.<br />
<br />
At this time to keep records organized, we use an outdated MS Access 2003 database to keep track of active clients, their pet’s medical records, special information about the care for the pets and volunteer information. Each client can have up to three spayed and or neutered pets in the program.<br />
To run these special free pet clinics, Seattle Humane Society utilizes volunteer veterinarians, licensed veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants. The current database also attempts to keep each of these volunteers information on file so that these professionals can be linked to the pets and clients that they see at each clinic.<br />
<br />
Seattle Humane Society’s other community service program, Pet Food Bank, helps low-income seniors with pet food and supplies deliveries on a monthly basis by volunteers. These clients and their pets are also entered into the database, but do not receive free basic veterinary care. It will be important to keep these clients separated from Pet Project clients since they receive different benefits. The same separation goes for Visiting Pet Friends. However, we do keep updated medical records, health information and certification records for pets in the Visiting Pet Friends program and would like to have medical record capabilities for this program as well as Pet Project.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We currently use an outdated MS Office Access 2003 database which no longer functions to support our growing program needs. This database has corrupted files and does not produce accurate reports for each unique Seattle Humane Society community outreach p<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> Seattle Humane Society’s Community Outreach team would like a new database designed for Pet Project to mimic a program like Cornerstone or Impromed veterinary software, while also creating a space to enter Pet Food Bank and Visiting Pet Friends volunteer information even though this program has as different goal. The new database must produce accurate reports which are communicated to our Board of Directors, staff and Foundations.<br />
Our IT department does have newer versions of Access, including 2007, 2010 and 2013; however the department lacks the technical skills and expertise to convert the current Access 2003 database into one of these newer versions. Also the data transfer into a new Access program may be complicated since the database in use has so many corrupt files.<br />
<br />
Seattle Humane Society is looking for help to create, design and/or upgrade our current Access Database to a functioning database to serve our community. This could be an online cloud-based database or a software-based database that lives on our internal server.
