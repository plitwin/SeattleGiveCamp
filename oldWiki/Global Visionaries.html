<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> Global Visionaries has done a lot of changing in the last few years, however, our website has remained the same. Stagnant and unappealing, our website fails to send the message that we are a vibrant nonprofit working to improve global citizenry and social justice.<br />
We would like an updated website that gets across our mission, vision, and allows visitors and program participants access to pertinent information.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Our website is hosted by Office365 and we use Sharepoint for proprietary or confidential information, iATS Payments for donations and program fees, and Google Docs for data capture forms.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We need something that is appealing and forward but able to be maintained and updated by our staff.
