<strong>Background</strong><br />
The Youth Tutoring Program is an after school, tutoring and mentoring program for at-risk youth living in 6 low and mixed income housing neighborhoods around Seattle. We have 465 volunteers who support us each week for 1-3 hours of one on one tutoring support. Our funding is tied to many things, one of which is accurately capturing the hours of support provided by our dedicated volunteers. Can you believe that we are capturing their time (hours, number of students supported, number of homework sessions provided, etc) on paper logs? These logs are hand delivered to our main office, where they are punched into the database. It is so archaic. Help!<br />
<br />
One of our sites is piloting a project hosted by Google docs where tutors log on and input their information. Works great, but we are ready for the next step and could really use some assistance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Request</strong><br />
As mentioned above, we are using paper/pencil to record our logs now. These logs are physically transported from the 6 centers to our Main Office, where they are punched into an Access database. We would love to have someone create a tool whereby volunteers could walk up to an open application on a dedicated desktop in each center, and complete an online form that would capture elements of the tutoring support they’ve provided on a particular day. We’re not interested in creating a mobile application as our form must hook up to our database through an intranet (and we’ve also found that tutors are horrible about logging their own hours remotely unless the supervisor catches them as they leave.) The fields we need to capture, for funding purposes, include whether they were present for tutoring, how many hours they supported on a particularly day, how many individual and group tutoring sessions they supported (with a breakdown of how many youth were in a group session) and how many homework sessions were assisted. The Main Office staff create monthly reports to funders using this data, and it would improve our overall reporting and our own internal analytical capabilities to be able to capture this more accurately, more quickly and more efficiently.<br />

<strong>Technology Preference:</strong><br />
We are open to any of your suggestions. We have requirements defined for what we want the application to do, and can collect information about our headquarter's network (Catholic Community Services) if that is necessary.
