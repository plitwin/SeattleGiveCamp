<strong>Work Request:</strong> Hello,<br />
Our educational nonprofit trains adults to teach English to non-native speakers. We provide training for public school teachers in WA, teachers working with the adult immigrant/refugee population, international students, and people planning to work overseas in a variety of settings. Our reach is primarily WA State/Northwest, but we sometimes attract people from across the U.S. and around the world.<br />
<br />
We currently have a WordPress website which we are happy with. We would be interested in SEO for this website. The internet is so &quot;noisy&quot; and it's hard for a small organization (with no tech support) like ours to stay competitive. We'd also like to integrate an older website (using Simple Machines Form) that is accessible only for our alumni into either our newer WordPress website or into our Facebook group, but we don't know which option is better or how to do that. It's become difficult to manage both and our alumni aren't being served as well.<br />
<br />
Please note that while we have a partner university, Seattle Pacific, the School of Teaching ESL is an independent nonprofit. We do not receive technical support from SPU and we maintain our own website and online learning platform.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your consideration.<br />
