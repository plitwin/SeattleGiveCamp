<span style="font-size: 14px;">Our website is old and needs to be updated with a new and exciting look. It needs to say more about our purpose and updated photos. It should grab the audience. The web-site needs better search engine functions and needs some flash. We would like to explore mobile apps and improve our Facebook page and add Twitter to our social media venue.</span><br />
