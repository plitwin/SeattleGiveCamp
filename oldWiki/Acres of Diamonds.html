<strong>Work Request:</strong> WEBSITE UPDATE/RESTRUCTURE. Current web site is on WordPress but not the design or navigation that is desired. Staff is very limited in ability to update/change web site. Desire to work with a team to redo the web site and get some training on how to navigate WordPress for future updates, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> WordPress (someone else built this site using existing templates)<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> Would like to stay on WordPress but not necessarily be restricted to the &quot;templates and themes&quot; in the version we have. Acres of Diamonds has undergone new leadership, making positive changes to help the women and children they serve and now would like to make a change to their web site. Thanks for your consideration!
