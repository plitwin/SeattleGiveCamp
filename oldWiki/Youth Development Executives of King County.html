<strong>Contact:</strong> Jessica Werner<br />
<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> Youth Development Executives of King County (YDEKC) is a coalition of youth-serving organizations working to together to build and unify the youth development field. We believe every young person has the opportunity and support they need to learn, lead, connect, contribute and thrive. Our coalition is comprised of 93 member organizations that serve thousands of youth across King County.<br />
<br />
Our website (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ydekc.org" rel="nofollow">ydekc.org</a>) provides information about our current efforts and connections to additional resources that are useful to (primarily) our members as well as others interested in the youth development field.<br />
<br />
Our main goal is to provide timely, accurate information to site visitors â€“ particularly our members. We hope it can be easier to navigate and is user-friendly for staff to maintain. Much of the content will remain static over a period of months, but we want some functionality to support current activities or calls to action.<br />
Our website should be a resource to share information and research (large files), news and events and connects to our e-news (MailChimp). We would like to build community awareness with the public and partners about the importance of the youth development field, as well as directly connect with our membership through the website.<br />
In addition to what we have currently, we hope the new website could include:<br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Log-in capabilities for members-only access to share and exchange exclusive information to our membership including file access, and possibly discussion capabilities.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The ability to host a third party payment system to accept donations and member pledges.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">An easy to read and easy to update event Calendar.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ability to store and upload large data or research documents.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Have the ability to organize, archive, and search through research documents.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Visually appealing, easy to navigate for public, but easy upkeep for staff.</span></li></ul><br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We are currently using WordPress.com, the blog format.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We are currently using WordPress.com and would be happy to move to WordPress.org format, if that allows for more website functionality.
