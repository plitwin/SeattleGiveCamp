<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> Here is the app so far:<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Project:</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">As our member food bank see more and more hungry people coming through their door, food flies off the shelf quicker, and the funding, along with the food, become scarce. We are looking for a mobile food app that allows for easy posting of food surpluses and food needs with a geolocating feature. It would connect consumer to food banks in Washington State. But it would be unique in it's ability to allow food banks and pantrys to directly connect with the app, and upload their &quot;list&quot; of food they are short on. Similarly, if someone in the Washington area has &quot;extra&quot; food, like a pear tree that they don't want the pears from, a food bank could see that there is an opportunity to use that food for clients.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Background:</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Through its statewide membership, Washington Food Coalition members find practical solutions to common challenges. The Coalition draws on the strength and reach of its membership to equip, educate and empower everyone working to end hunger in our state.

 <br />
Washington Food Coalition's Get Food Now app, currently available to Android users, quickly and easily connects you to your local food bank so that food donations are made with ease.<br />
We developed the Get Food Now app to post any amount of excess food that you, your family or your business might have. The nearby food pantries will automatically receive a notice through email to come pick up the food.<br />
Include on the front page of the app allows for descriptions and instructions for pickup (i.e. &quot;come and get it!&quot;, &quot;call before coming&quot;, &quot;ask front desk for donation&quot;, etc.) as well as one or more pieces of contact information. You can also access a statewide map of food banks and deliver the food nearby if you prefer.<br />
For food banks, they can access donation information on either the phone app or computer. Each food bank is assigned a unique ID to login to the website, allowing them to track donations and pickup completion. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Get Food Now was designed for hunger relief agencies in Washington State and currently only extends to the borders of the state.</span><br />
