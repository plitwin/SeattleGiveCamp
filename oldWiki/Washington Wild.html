<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Website Upgrade Proposal</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> <strong>Upgrade current website(</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wawild.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wawild.org/</a>)<span style="font-size: 14px;"> from <strong>Joomla</strong> 1.0.15 to most current stable version with all patches and interim updates. This would include transferring the current template with customizations, security features, all current and archived content and existing Facile Forms to the new version.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Replace non-functioning Acajoom module used for newsletter sign up with a link to a Constant Contact sign up page so individuals can automatically sign up on our website to receive our newsletter that is sent out using Constant Contact.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Review security features on website, make recommendations for improvements and install any recommended changes based on new upgrade.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Test upgrades, fix any incompatibilities and take updated website live.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Assist volunteer board member in updating website operations manual to reflect any new operating system changes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> We have reviewed all the requirements for participation in this project and can meet those requirements. Your team would be working with the person who originally worked with the volunteer web developer to create the site and the Executive Director, who will have the ability to authorize all necessary changes in the site.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">About:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Seattle GiveCamp 2013 Proposal</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Washington Wild is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that protects and restores Washingtonâ€™s wild lands and rivers through education, advocacy and civic engagement. Since its founding in 1979, we have been instrumental in permanently protecting over 1 million acres of wilderness in Washington State including most recently the Wild Sky Wilderness. We are currently working on proposals to protect more than 400,000 acres of new wilderness and more than 900 miles of wild and scenic rivers. These initiatives include expanding the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and, with our Wild Olympics Campaign, to protecting additional wilderness and wild rivers on the Olympic peninsula. Both of these measures have received wide support and have been introduced into Congress for passage. With 10,000 members and supporters, Washington Wild is the oldest and largest wilderness preservation organization in Washington.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Our current website is a Joomla based site using a standardized template from Rocket Theme that was slightly customized using standard template options. The site was developed from a static html-based site in 2007 with entirely volunteer help. The site was upgraded through January 2008 to Joomla 1.0.15 but has not been upgraded since that time except for certain security specific modifications (installing captcha boxes) and an extra front end log in.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> We now find that certain features, such as Acajoom, which we had previously used to allow supporters to sign up to receive our newsletter, are either no longer functional or there are better modules available to perform these functions. Because we have not upgraded our website, we are unable to take advantage of these improvements (and others) and will continue to be unable to do so in the future until we upgrade our site.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> Upgrading from Joomla Version 1.x is not a task we have the technical ability to perform in-house given the significant changes that were made in subsequent Joomla versions that do not allow a direct upgrade.</span><br />

<strong>What We Accomplished:</strong><br />
<br />
We accomplished a full migration of the Washington Wild website from Joomla 1.0 to 2.5. Much of these had to be done manually as there is no longer an upgrade path from Joomla 1.0 to 1.5. Thus we had to first do a manual migration of SQL table structure from 1.0 to 1.5 (they did not share the same tabling structure), followed by a migration from Joomla 1.5 to 2.5. After the final migration we had to migrate the theme over, as well as the pictures for the 300 page website.<br />
<br />
We installed two new extensions to deal with components that no longer existed for Joomla 1.0. Because of this we had to manually recreate the content that was stored in these original components.<br />
<br />
From there we streamlined processes within the website. This included things such as signing up for the newsletter and submitting forms. In addition we also fixed the many broken links and sections of the site that no longer appeared.<br />
<br />
The final work was done making sure the website looked the same. Extensive work was done on elements such as the header, logo, and forms to make sure that a casual visitor would not even notice the entire website was new. Once that was finished we transfered the new website and went live.<br />
<br />
The entire operation was a complete success in that a casual visitor will not even notice that the website has changed at all, but in reality every aspect in running the site is completely new, easier to update, and much more secure.
