<strong>Contact:</strong> Leah Krieger, Executive Director<br />
<br />
<strong>Work Request:</strong> To increase our chances of a match, we’ve identified four different projects (in order of priority).<br />
GiveCamp can choose any ONE of the projects based on technical expertise available among your volunteers and scope of work that can be done in one weekend.<br />
<ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Redesign Current Website or Create New Website (All content &amp; graphics will be provided.)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Automate survey collection (ideally, embed survey to every receipt sent via PayTrace, which is what we use to collect payment.)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Create a dashboard that can bring all the sales &amp; marketing metrics in one place with KPI for the Executive Director to have an at-a-glance view.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Create and embed code for a self-test on our website.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong>Current System:</strong><br />
<ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">We currently use WordPress for our website, and we would like to stay with WordPress because it’s easy to update.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Nothing is in place to conduct survey electronically.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Nothing is in place to pull all data into one place. We currently use Google A</span></li></ol><br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We are open to any technology recommended by your expert volunteers. Sustainability is important to us – which means three things to us: Free or low cost, Easy future maintenance &amp; modification, and Robust support. We’re comfortable with open-source tools if they meet the above listed criteria.
