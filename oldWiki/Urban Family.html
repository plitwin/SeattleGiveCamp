<strong>Work Request:</strong> Urban Family (UF) is currently seeking a free data software system to aid our organization in data collection and tracking. We are open to any options Seattle GiveCamp can offer us, but primarily we would like to have a software created that we can input and track the data that we collect from the clients we serve. Urban Family is a growing organization that needs to expand in the area of data collection to illustrate the successful work that our organization carries out, as well as capture the nature of the clients we serve Urban Family provides services and programs for youth and their families in the South Seattle (Skyway) area.<br />
<br />
As of now all of our data still remains on paper, so as UF expands in collecting data (demographics of our clients, as well as using surveys to capture their emotions, behaviors, and experiences). We hope to be able to collect a greater amount of detailed data for our clients overall, as well as collect data broken down by our various programs. By learning more about our clientele and their surrounding issues, we can better serve our community by tailoring our programs to their needs and we would also be able to measure our success with regard to our impact on their lives.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current System:</strong> We currently do not use any particular program or software to complete our data collection because we have not been tracking the data of our clients very closely. As of now, our data still remains on paper and we need a place to input it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Technology Preference:</strong> We do not have a technology preference and we are open to all technology options.
