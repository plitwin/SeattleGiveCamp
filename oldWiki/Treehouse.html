<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Project:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Treehouse launched a rebrand and new Wordpress website on March 20, 2013. The website can be found at www.treehouseforkids.org. In addition to bringing the website up to date with our new look and feel, the goal was to increase web traffic and improve its performance. While we have received rave reviews regarding the look and usability of the site, we have been monitoring Google Analytics for five months now and our total site traffic has in fact been about 40% down overall since the transition. Needless to say this is concerning and we would like to address the issue. Looking closer at the analytics we noticed that the traffic mix has changed considerably since the transition. With our old site, the majority of our traffic came in via search (55-65%). Now we are closer to 30-35% of our traffic coming in via search and that percentage has been declining. We have taken a stab at utilizing a WordPress SEO plugin called &quot;All in one SEO Pack&quot; but do not have an in-house expert to share how to best use it or perhaps to suggest a plugin that might work better. Based on our limited understanding of SEO, we have only grazed the surface and could really use some guidance.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">We are currently using a WordPress plug-in for SEO called All in One SEO Pack, but we do not have the in-house experience to know if it is the plug-in we should be using and/or how to best utilize the tool. Whatever tool we end up using will need to be compliant with WordPress.</span><br />
