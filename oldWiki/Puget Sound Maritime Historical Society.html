 <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society’s mission is to create appreciation of the Puget Sound region’s maritime past in order to better understand the present. To that end, the Society maintains in Seattle a collection of ship models and other maritime artifacts, as well as historic photos, ship’s plans, and books. We also publish quarterly our journal of maritime history,The Sea Chest. We have been a partner with Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry for over 50 years. Our offices and collection are housed in MOHAI’s current location alongside the Montlake Cut, and the Society is actively planning with MOHAI for its move to the Naval Armory on Lake Union in 2012.</span><br />

<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Project Proposal"></a>Project Proposal</h2>
 Seeking an updated website which non-technical people can update. Prefer something other than WordPress. Site should be easily viewed on mobile devices. Also looking for help creating better content on our Facebook page, starting to use Twitter, and ways of linking the two. The goal is to encourage younger people to become interested in our organization. Reviewing the current website and developing a scope of work for modernizing it is the top priority.<br />
