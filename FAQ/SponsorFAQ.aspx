<p>
    If I make a donation to this event, will I be recognized on the website?
</p>
<p>
    Yes. If you make a donation, you will receive recognition on the Sponsor page.
</p>
<p>
    Is your group a non-profit? Are donations tax deductible?
</p>
<p>
    We have the ability to receive donations through the National GiveCamp 501C earmarked for the Seattle GiveCamp even though Seattle GiveCamp is not a
    non-profit. And while we can’t give tax advice, it’s more than likely that donations would be tax deductible.
</p>
<p>
    What types of donations are you looking for?
</p>
<p>
    Goods. Money. You name it!
