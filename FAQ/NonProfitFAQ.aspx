   <h2>
    On-site: Where do I go?
</h2>
<p>
    See <a href="http://seattlegivecamp.org/FAQ/Location.aspx">location page</a>. Expect an email regarding details a day or two before the event.
</p>
<h2>
    On-site: Will I be fed?
</h2>
<p>
    Absolutely. You can eat with the volunteers when you are there. See <a href="http://seattlegivecamp.org/FAQ/Agenda.aspx">agenda page</a> for info on meals.
</p>
<h2>
    What is a Seattle Give Camp?
</h2>
<p>
    A GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, and database administrators donate their time to create custom software for
    non-profit organizations. This custom software could be a new website for the nonprofit organization, a small data-collection application to keep track of
    members, or a application for the Red Cross that automatically emails a blood donor three months after they’ve donated blood to remind them that they are
    now eligible to donate again. The only limitation is that the project should be scoped to be able to be completed in a weekend.
</p>
<h2>
    When is the deadline for submitting proposals?
</h2>
<p>
    That information can be found on the <a href="../Nonprofit.aspx"> page</a>
</p>
<h2>
    What do you need from me?
</h2>
<p>
    Start off with completing the Charity Proposal form on this site <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RKi0Z6rtgyaTXokeb6OQ0x64TV4xFo9wWfa2KK3l-Ng/viewform?usp=send_form">located here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Success for each charity depends on a couple of things, but all starts with involvement. It’s critical that members of the charity be available before,
    during and after the event to ensure that your development team is successful. If your organization is selected, the following requirements are made:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        A representative from your charity <b>must attend the kick-off meeting on Friday from <u>6pm to 9pm (possibly a little later)</u></b>. 
        This person should be knowledgeable about the proposal document
        and the work that our developers are being asked to do.
    </li>
    <li>
        At least one representative from your organization <b>must be available <u>on site</u> for 
            <u>at least two hours</u> on Saturday</b> and be available by phone at other times (9am to 6pm) 
            so that any questions about the
        application can be answered and the team has the information they need to complete their 
            assigned tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Members of your organization that will be maintaining the application after the event is over 
        are encouraged to attend one of the various training
        sessions that will be conducted during the weekend.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lastly, at least one member of your organization <b>must be <u>on site</u> for the handoff and final presentation
        on Sunday during the hours of <u>1pm to 6pm</u></b> to see the results and take possession of the application. The
        people you send should include the organization’s technical expert, if possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It goes without saying that the most successful nonprofit projects result from a strong commitment to participate my members of the nonprofit, so you’re
    strongly encouraged to exceed the above minimums. <b>Please realize that being available by phone or online is NOT an acceptable substitute for the on site requirements; 
    if you can't be availabe on site during the required times, your application will be disqualified.</b>
</p>
<h2>
    How will the Noprofits be selected?
</h2>
<p>
    We will select the number of nonprofits to be helped based on the number of developer volunteers we receive. Our goal is to provide support to 20+ nonprofits
    in the Seattle area.
</p>
<h2>
    What should my Nonprofit Proposal include?
</h2>
<p>
    Your proposal will be used as the blueprint for your application. The more specific your proposal the happier you will be with your application. This is
    just some of the information that you might wish to include:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        What is the objective of the system? Describe the problem this system will solve.
    </li>
    <li>
        Are you requesting a new application or an update to an existing application?
    </li>
    <li>
        If it is not a new application what software was used to create your existing solution?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will you be hosting your application?
    </li>
    <li>
        What information will you need to track?
    </li>
    <li>
        Do any users have special needs?
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe the ongoing needs for importing data into the system, and exporting it from the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        List any reports.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe performance requirements, issues, and concerns.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe security requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    See the <a href="http://seattlegivecamp.org/NonProfit.aspx">charity proposal form</a> for more details.
</p>
<h2>
    What if I am not sure what to propose?
</h2>
<p>
    See <a href="http://seattlegivecamp.org/NonProfit.aspx">proposal suggestions</a> on our nonprofit information page.
</p>
<h2>
    What if I need to modify my proposal after I have submitted it?
</h2>
<p>
    Before the submission deadline, submit a new proposal and mention in the notes that this proposal replaces
    the original proposal from your organization.
    After the submission deadline, you ask you not to alter your proposal unless you learn new information that
    affects the proposal (e.g., we wish to withdraw our proposal or our web hosting company or software has 
    changed since our submission). You can email us at <a href="mailto:info@seattlegivecamp.org">info@seattlegivecamp.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    When will I know if my proposal has been selected?
</h2>
<p>
    All non-profits submitting proposals for Seattle GiveCamp will be contacted by mid-September.
</p>
<h2>
    What happens after I am selected?
</h2>
<p>
    If you are one of the charities that are selected, we will contact you to finalize your design requirements.
</p>
<p>
    When do we have to be at Seattle GiveCamp? See above under <strong>What do you need from me?</strong> for&nbsp; details.</p>
        <p>
    What if no one from my organization can make it to the event?
<strong>Your application will be disqualified.</strong></p>
<h2>
    Will I be able to modify the solution?
</h2>
<p>
    Yes! Each nonprofit will be provided transition information in how to maintain their application once the weekend is over. This is why it is critical that someone from the
    organization be on site Sunday afternoon so we can share that information with your organization. And depending on the technology used, this person
    may need to be technical.
